    <a href="https://www.signal.org/" target="_blank">Signal</a> is a messaging app by Open Whisperer Systems,
    just like WhatsApp or iMessage or Facebook Messenger, but one that's geared towards privacy and security. It's
    encrypted, simple, and free.
</p>

<h3>Signal Vs WhatsApp</h3>


<p>
    They both use the same underlying encryption "the Signal Protocol" but drastically differ
    in terms of underlying philosophy.
</p>

<p>
    WhatsApp can't see what's inside the messages, but they can see who is sending a message to whom and
    when - which is a large risk.
    And according to the WhatsApp privacy policy, <strong>the company reserves the right to record this
        information, known as message metadata</strong>, and give it to governments.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The only data Signal retains is the phone number you register with and when you last logged
        into their server.</strong>
    That's it. It doesn't even record the hour, minute, or second - only the day.
</p>

<p>
    Signal is open-source and funded by donors, on the other hand WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, leaves users
    to being nothing more than another data collection point for Facebook for ad-targeting.
    WhatsApp was a messaging app first and added the security features later. Signal was all about security
    first. Because of this, WhatsApp has more now-traditional chat features. Both Signal and WhatsApp also include
    voice calling and video calling to round out the messaging apps.

<p>
    Signal has plenty of features too including GIFs, can send your location, and Signal even has disappearing
    messages.Even voice calls on Signal are encrypted and screenshots can be disabled.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Signal, the non-profit organization, points out that "there are no ads, no affiliate marketers, no
    creepy tracking", and it's hard to ask for much more than that in terms of privacy. And It's recommended by
    Edward Snowden.
    When you have an alternative which doesn't need you to compromise on privacy, why not to switch to
    Signal.

Background

  I always felt having a search in any website is useful, and I wanted to have one in mine. Even though I know how to
  exactly navigate to the content I want in my website, I sometimes feel lazy and wish I had a quick way to ask and get
  what I want.


  The reasons why I want search are maybe obvious, but for some reason I had a fee… </p>

  Once I was reading about how Amazon gave a platform for many small businesses to sell products online and how it
  helped them. You might even have heard that, but think about it, whenever we buy something from a small business on
  Amazon, we often relate it as we bought it from Amazon and never really remember the seller or the creator. This

  Recently when I was speaking about data privacy to a friend, he said "How do I get affected if my data is collected,
  in a way I am getting personal suggestions, so it seems to be good, as I have nothing to hide?"


  We usually listen to this in various forms, from many people around us, so I want to bring this up to you.


  The way we think … </p>
