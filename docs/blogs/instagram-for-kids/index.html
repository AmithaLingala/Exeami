              If you have an Instagram account for your babies or plan to have one, I want you to think twice before
              doing it.
              Most of us are immature and innocent and follow the trend without being fully aware that some things we
              share on the
              internet might be bad for us and our loved ones in many ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to point out a few reasons why sharing too much about kids online is not a good idea.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Consent</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>When sharing personal details, pictures and day-to-day activities of your kids online, you are
                  creating
                  a personally identifiable <strong>permanent digital footprint</strong> of them whether they like it or
                  not. I
                  feel that kids
                  should have a right to their digital privacy, as some of these details or fame might change events in
                  their
                  lives the way they don't want them to be, and they might not even be able to change it.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Safety</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Everyone wants to safeguard and protect their kids as they love them, and it's their duty, and they
                  are
                  responsible for the kid's safety. Predators, stalkers, and paedophiles are all over the internet. It's
                  an easy
                  way to get
                  the information, so please don't be the one who provides it. I heard some parents sharing full names,
                  locations,
                  school names, bus timings, activities, and everything on social media that can become a huge safety
                  concern. If
                  not, the photo you thought was cute might expose your kids to bullies.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Misuse</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The photos you share can be misappropriated and reused, or others use them for commercial purposes
                  without your
                  knowledge. <a href="https://firewalltimes.com/instagram-data-breach-timeline/">Do not think that just
                    because
                    you have a private account, you can control who gets access to the photos.</a>
                </p>

              <dt>Comparison</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Based on the <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-023-00013-0">DIPF | Leibniz Institute for
                    Research and
                    Information in Education, and Center for Research on Individual Development and Adaptive Education
                    of Children
                    at Risk (IDeA)</a> paper demonstrating that upward social
                  comparison, comparing with people
                  we consider to be socially better off is associated with reduced
                  well-being such as lower life satisfaction or more depressive symptoms. The better the lives of others
                  on social
                  media, the worse we feel. Many parents compare parenting standards and doubt themselves. Many feel
                  depressed
                  when
                  they get fewer likes on their baby's pictures. This is not only bad for your mental health but also
                  affects the
                  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2156869320912520">child's well-being in the
                    long
                    term.</a>

              </dd>
              <dt>Discomfort</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>How much time do you spend getting the right picture with perfect lighting? How many photos are you
                  taking? And
                  how much time are you editing and trying to make it the best? And are you doing this for fun or for
                  likes and comments? Taking a few pictures on occasion is good, but when we fall into the trap of
                  being emotionally attached to the engagement of our posts, we might end up causing discomfort to our
                  loved ones
                  by unconsciously forcing them to do things that they don't want to do.
                </p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              Some parents might be doing this for commercial reasons, I don't have a say in it. But if you are doing it
              as
              everyone
              else doing it or for making a digital album and sharing it with close friends and family. I recommend
              sharing on an
              end-to-end encrypted channel like <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The above applies if you only post photos of your children to your personal account, and you shouldn't
              feel a
              false sense of protection. I focused on sperate account, as this means you plan to share a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Always ask yourself if it is needed or worth the attention and virtual fame before posting anything about
              your
              babies online. Stay safe.
