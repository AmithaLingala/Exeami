  Once I was reading about how Amazon gave a platform for many small businesses to sell products online and how it
  helped them. You might even have heard that, but think about it, whenever we buy something from a small business on
  Amazon, we often relate it as we bought it from Amazon and never really remember the seller or the creator. This
  might seem trivial, but imagine if you were a seller of handmade crafts on Amazon and you had a loyal customer base
  and a good reputation. What if
  <a href="https://the-digital-reader.com/amazon-is-still-banning-authors-for-no-reason/">Amazon suddenly banned you
    from selling on their platform</a>,
  and you lost your source
  of income and your hard work? Or what if you had to <a
    href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/amazon-sellers-say-the-tech-giant-is-crushing-them-with">lower
    your prices to compete with other sellers?</a> Or <a
    href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/amazon-imposes-new-fee-on-sellers-shipping-their-own-products/articleshow/102833427.cms">pay
    a fee to
    Amazon and limit your profit margin?</a>
  Or what if you couldn't sell your products anywhere else for <a
    href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-keeps-prices-artificially-high-210059691.html">a lower price than on
    Amazon</a>
  , and you were stuck with their rules? Or
  <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-sellers-fear-bankruptcy-after-rule-change-12936803">they suddenly change
    terms and don't pay you?</a>
  Amazon is one of many examples to show the control of big corporations have on us.
</p>

<p>
  Every <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silo</a> site which is not yours, your data might feel like yours, but it
  is not.

    "Writing on your own website associates your thoughts and ideas with you as a person. Having a distinct website
    design helps strengthen that association. Writing for another publication, you get a little circular avatar at the
    beginning of the post and a brief bio at the end of the post, and that's about it. People will remember the
    publication, but probably not your name."

  When you know this, you want to change it and do something to change it. You also want your loved ones to be aware
  of it and own their data. The good news is, you are not alone. It's wonderful to connect with people who share your
  vision and work together for a better future. When I first got to know about IndieWeb It felt like a hope.
</p>
<h3>What is IndieWeb?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>As Indie web is about ownership, Your content is yours, and You are in control.</strong>
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://indieweb.org/" class="quote">
  <p>
    "The IndieWeb is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple
    standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your
    ownsite (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data."
  </p>

<h3>Why do we need IndieWeb?</h3>
There are many reasons why It is good to have your space on the web where you own what is yours. I am just listing
down a few.
<ol>
  <li>
    If you do not want to part of social media where the more you spend time and contribute, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising">the more they learn about you
      and sell you</a> (sell your browsing habits to advertisers).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't want Silos, control your experience of the web and decide <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">what you see</a> and <a
      href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/12/how-seo-is-gentrifying-the-internet">where your content goes.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't want to be part of evil where once you create a community, they keep it under paywall or
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/login_wall">authwall</a> and
    leave you
    choose to <a
      href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw">obey
      their rules or lose the community.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/tech/11271562/instagram-users-lose-accounts-taylor-swift/">don't want to
      need permission</a> to communicate, create and innovate with people around the globe with the
    internet.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't want to <a
      href="https://www.howtogeek.com/403769/what-happens-to-your-digital-property-when-a-company-goes-out-of-business/">
      lose all your data because the company gone out of business.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to show that you are not consumed by the Silos.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want different monetization for your content in your way.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>It's not just ownership</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/personal-domain">Identity</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Having a personal domain, which is the initial step of Indie web. It helps you to have more credibility,
    improves personal branding and makes it easy to find you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">Syndication</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>If you want to let your friends read your posts, their way using social media like Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter
    etc. You can post content on your site and publish links to 3rd party silos using POSSE (Publish (on your) Own
    Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) And can back feed the post activity back to your website. Now we can have all in one
    place, IndieWeb comments, and comments on your POSSE copies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Web Mentions</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Web Mentions is a simple communication protocol between websites that enables cross-site conversations and
    website can display comments, likes, or other response. With Web mentions you are better connected, you decide
    what and how to display the interaction on the content you own.
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>IndieAuth provides the ability to use your website (domain) to authenticate yourself on the web using a
    federated login protocol for Web sign-in.
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/microformats">MicroFormats</a></strong></dt>
  <dd> Add Microformats to your existing HTML to use structured data from your site to allow tools like feed readers.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Finally, It can be easy too…</h3>
<p>
  I know many might think,</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is easy to create a silo account and post what they want with few steps.</li>
  <li>I am not a celebrity or a company to own a domain.</li>
  <li>I am not a web developer and I don't know how to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There can many reasons and excuses we give ourselves to start. Even I am new to this, yet to understand a lot. Having
  a sense of ownership gives pleasure and made me take my first step, you can find yours.
</p>
<p>
  There are many <a href="https://indieweb.org/tools">tools</a>, <a
    href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started">step-by-step guides</a> and <a
    href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">help</a> available in
  the community to make it easy. Many smart people are
  contributing to make it easier so that we can own what is ours.
</p>
<p>
  Do it for yourself, have fun and pride creating something that is yours, and It will get easy.
