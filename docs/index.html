    <h2>Little about me...</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Hi 👋,
    I'm <span class="p-name">Amitha Lingala</span>, aka exeami.
    I'm a <span class="p-job-title">Software Engineer</span>, currently living in London.

    I enjoy creating stuff, be it a DIY craft that recycles things around the house or some new recipe to try, or code
    which does cool things.

    Also, I like things organized and ends up spending a lot of time planning.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media besides
    LinkedIn (where I have zero activity), and the best way to know me more is this website.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to contact me, you can email me at <a class="u-email"
      href="mailto:contact@exeami.com">contact@exeami.com</a>,
    and you can also find me on
    <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AmithaLingala">GitHub</a> and
    <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amithalingala">LinkedIn</a>!

    <h2>About this website</h2>
  </div>
  <p>This is my personal website, this site is always under development as I am learning and changing things here
    constantly.</p>

  <h3 class="title"> Exeami 🤔?</h3>
  <p>
    When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
    to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
    felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment, it made a lot of sense, as I took
    Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
    executables 😛) and Ami from Amitha.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 class="title">What's in here?</h3>
  <p>
    As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform to share my thoughts on various
    topics, I will be sharing the things I find interesting. Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel
    most important to know and talk about in this digital world.
    Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.</p>
  <p>
    You can find my <a href="/blogs">blogs</a> which generally are detailed articles and <a href="/posts">posts</a>
    which are collection of some quick writings and things I find on the internet. I also have a few of my <a
      href="/projects">projects</a> here.
  </p>
  <p>You can subscribe to feeds for my <a href="/blogs/atom.xml">blogs</a> and <a href="/posts/atom.xml">posts</a> now.

    <h3>NextCloud Cookbook</h3>
    <p>
    I found <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook">NextCloud Cookbook</a>, and it's so easy to organize my
    recipes now.

</p>
<p>
    I used to bookmark my recipes. Recently, I am trying so many new recipes from online and didn't like the way I am
    organizing my bookmarks. Then I found nextcloud cookbook. To add a recipe to
    the collection, all you have to do is paste in the URL of the recipe, it parses and downloads the recipe to your
    specified nextcloud folder as JSON.
</p>
<p>
    For the cookbook to parse your recipe, it should follow a schema.org recipe format. In my experience, most of the
    recipe sites are using this schema.
</p>
<p>
    I used <a href="https://codeberg.org/codingotaku/recipe-crawler">Recipe
        Crawler</a> to parse all my current bookmarks at once and copied to my nextcloud recipe folder. Now, I can
    filter by tags, categories, they even have <a
        href="https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook/blob/master/docs/user/clients/Index.md">Mobile app</a> which made my
    life easier.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you, Nextcloud Cookbook!

    <h3>I bought Kobo Elipsa</h3>
    <p>
    I don't want to buy anything unless I feel it's absolutely needed. I believe everyone is trying to sell you
    something, and it is important to not fall in the trap and become a lifelong consumer (I know I can't avoid it most
    of the time). This post is mostly to justify myself for buying Kobo elipsa. I bought <a
        href="https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa">Kobo elipsa</a> after thinking of
    buying it for
    more than 6 months, and it is one of the very few things which did not make me hate myself for buying it.
</p>
<p>
    I like to read, but books are costly and sometimes not accessible to read, maybe due to the size of the book or
    font. I can buy an e-reader, but I feel my book reading
    is incomplete if I don't underline the lines I like.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I
    can
    download books as PDF or EPUB from <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, copy to my elipsa
    and read. Elipsa lets me make notes on my downloaded books, which is not the case for may e-readers out there, which
    is the reason I picked this.
</p>
<p>
    I have to have a notebook for each purpose, I keep buying notebooks and never feel I have enough. Now, with elipsa I
    feel so relaxed that I can have a separate notebook for each of my needs, they gave quite few backgrounds for notes
    which makes it even more helpful.
</p>
<p>I think their handwriting to text conversion is good that it was able to convert my bad writing to beautiful notes
    which is a plus, even though I really don't need this feature.</p>
<p>
    They have only Dropbox and Google Drive as cloud storage options, I couldn't configure Nextcloud as storage yet.
</p>
<p>
    I got the e-reader, stylus and cover for £299. There might be e-reader with the same features out there, I couldn't
    find anything cheaper than this. Unless, you have similar requirements, I won't recommend buying it.
</p>
<p>I will try to write a complete review of Kobo Elipsa after using it for little longer, as of now, I am enjoying my
    reading and writing on Elipsa.</p>
