  Recently when I was speaking about data privacy to a friend, he said
  "How do I get affected if my data is collected, in a way I am getting personal suggestions, so it seems
  to
  be
  good, as I have nothing to hide?" <br><br>
  We usually listen to this in various forms, from many people around us, so I want to bring this up to
  you.<br><br>

  The way we think about privacy is misleading.<br><br>
  You might say how can I watching a song of my favorite singer last night can possibly affect me? or
  things I
  search for my academic project will harm me?<br>
  It's not the bits of data, but the complete profile of you collected from different sources. All of it
  combined
  can provide a detailed profile of you that even you didn't know of.

</p>
<div class="container is-fluid ">
  <p class="subtitle"><strong>Why is it harmful?</strong></p><br>
  <dl class="box">
    <dt><strong>1. Protect your freedom of thought</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box">Have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect"
        target="_blank">"Hawthorne
        Effect"</a>? Let me tell you, people behave differently if they know they are
      being
      watched. <br>
      If I say, "you exploring things about your sexuality or religious beliefs or medical problems
      today
      may
      cause you to lose your dream job after 10 years or a maybe physical threat to you or your family
      by
      unacceptable
      society,
      will you do that?" <br>
      This is not hoaxed, your employer with your profile in hand with opposite beliefs can target you
      and
      your
      comment on
      some social media might keep your life at risk by the mob.<br>
      <span class=" has-text-danger-dark">The point is, if you don't have the privacy to do this kind
        of
        self-exploration, you aren't free.</span><br>
    </dd><br><br>
    <dt><strong>2. Price Discrimination</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box">"Relevant ads are nice, at least I am not seeing some lipstick ad which I am least
      interested to
      watch", says
      one
      of my friends. It would be fine if you decided to give up this information for tangible benefits
      right?<br>
      If I say these exciting bargains are everything personal about you: your age, income, family's
      ages, and
      income,
      medical history, dietary habits, favorite web sites, your birthday...the list goes on and <span
        class=" has-text-danger-dark">may never
        see a
        benefit aside from this ad</span> , and no ones including you in the decision.</dd><br><br>
    <dt><strong>3. Identity theft</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft" target="_blank">Identity
        theft</a>
      is
      usually done for
      financial gain, but it will be possible to steal your sensitive data from
      your accounts as well as those belonging to your family, friends and can use your credentials to
      harm
      your
      reputation or cause online public humiliation.</dd><br><br>
    <dt><strong>4. Privacy is Human right</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box">Generations before ours fought for our right to privacy.
      Not caring about it shows little knowledge about the history and the importance of it.<br>
      It's a human right just like the right to equality, to justice, freedom, a nationality, the
      right to
      religion,
      etc. <br>
      It's your Data, it exists because you exist and you have complete right on every byte of it,
      playing
      around
      psychologically to steal data or to use it without your consent for personal gain, making you a
      fool by
      hiding
      things is not right and never will be.<br>
      Simply it's <span class=" has-text-danger-dark">NOT ETHICAL</span>.</dd><br><br>
    <dt><strong>5. The creepers</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box">How do you feel if someone is constantly listening to you when you are discussing a
      sensitive
      or personal
      topic? <br>
      I will say it's happening right now. Your own devices, you got for your convenience are spying
      on
      you.<br>
      Sometimes a user, by default, is opted into being tracked by the listening devices (aka personal
      assistants
      like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/amazon-alexa-recordings-romania-sex-privacy-1452173"
        target="_blank">Alexa</a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/29/apples-siri-routinely-records-you-having-sex/"
        target="_blank">Siri</a>,
      and <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/11/technology/google-home-mini-security-flaw/index.html"
        target="_blank">Google
        Home</a>) which records your private conversations without your consent.<br>
      And are being listened by not just some algorithm, but by a human.
    </dd><br><br>
    <dt><strong>6. The Filter bubble</strong></dt><br>
    <dd class="box">Did we talk about personal suggestions? They are good right, what possibly can be
      bad
      about
      having the
      things on the plate which we want? Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble"
        target="_blank">"filter
        bubble"</a>.<br>
      Filter bubbles refer to the state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized
      searches
      on
      search engines or social media sites. As a result,<span class=" has-text-danger-dark">users
        become
        separated
        from most information that
        presents
        an opposing viewpoint.</span> <br>
      If I say for example you don't want to wear a mask and if you search about it, if this filter
      bubble
      shows you
      the things which might bad for wearing a mask and make your opinion stronger and make you feel
      good,
      but if you don't know the use of that it might make your life risky.

    These are just six good reasons to care about data privacy, there are lot more things we need to
    worry
    about.<br>
    we will meet again here as privacy cannot be covered in a single blog post.<br><br>
    I want to conclude with Edward Snowden's quote,<br>
  <p class="box notification is-dark"><i>"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because
      you
      have
      nothing to hide, is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have
      nothing
      to
      say."</i>
