  <h3>Story behind my logo</h3>
  <p>
    I use my logo everywhere online as my profile picture, and often people ask me about it. When you look at my logo,
    it might look like it doesn't have any meaning, but it does!

      When I tried to design a logo for my website, I spent a lot of time (I am bad at it), and my best was this cute
      lion made out of letters in "exeami".<br>

      I was very proud of it. But wherever I used it, the details of the logo were not visible. <br>
      I was back to square
      one. I wanted my logo to be noticeable, even in favicon, and represent me.

    <figure class="is-180x180">
      <img class="posts-item" id="logo-old" src="/images/logos/logo-old.svg" width="612" height="612" />
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>
    After struggling with my logo design skills, I decided to use symbols instead of writing letters.<br> Here is my
    logo.

    <figure class="is-180x180">
      <img class="posts-item" id="logo-new" src="/images/logos/exeami.webp" width="612" height="612" />
    </figure>

      As you might already know, my name is Amitha which means boundless, limitless or infinite (which
      can be a perfect symbol for my logo). This is a platform to group my thoughts in one place using code, So the code
      block {}. Wrapping amitha in code block {âˆž} is what my logo is. I made some changes to make it look like a person
      with glasses (maybe it's just for me, as I stared at it long enough and imagined things ðŸ˜›), I got my logo. I
      ended up using it everywhere not just in this website :).
