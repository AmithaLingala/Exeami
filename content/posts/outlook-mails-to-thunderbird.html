  I had some outlook backup files and I wanted to open them in Thunderbird. I spent some time figuring out how to do it.
  So, documenting it here. I know there might be better ways to do it, but it these steps worked for me.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convert PST file to MBOX using PST converter tool like <a
      href="https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php">Sysinfo Linux PST Converter.</a></li>
  <li>Create a folder in your system, this will be used to store the mails.</li>
  <li>Copy the MBOX file to the folder you created and remove the file extension (e.g., example.mbx to example)</li>
  <li>Repeat the above step if you have multiple .pst files</li>
  <li>Add the folder you created to Thunderbird.
    <code>Settings -&gt; Account Settings-&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Add Local folder</code>
    <figure>

    (If you don't see <i>Add Local folder</i>, install </code> <a
      href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/localfolder/">LocalFolders Extension</a>).
  </li>
  <li>Close and open Thunderbird, and you should be able to read your Outlook mails.</li>
