  I had some outlook backup files and I wanted to open them in Thunderbird. I spent some time figuring out how to do it.
  So, documenting it here. I know there might be better ways to do it, but it these steps worked for me.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convert PST file to MBOX using PST converter tool like <a
      href="https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php">Sysinfo Linux PST Converter</a></li>
  <li>Create a local folder (xxx) and add it to Thunderbird (Add <a
      href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/localfolder/">LocalFolders Extension</a> if needed)
    and close thunderbird.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder you created (xxx), and you can see a list of files for each mail folder (e.g., Inbox and
    Inbox.msf).</li>
  <li>Rename the MBOX file you created to one of the file names (eg., Inbox) and copy to the above folder,
    overwriting the Inbox file (leave Inbox.msf untouched).</li>
  <li>Open Thunderbird, and you should be able to read your Outlook mails.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If you have multiple .pst files, you might need to repeat these steps for each file.
