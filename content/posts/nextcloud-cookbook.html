    I found <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook">NextCloud Cookbook</a>, and it's so easy to organize my
    recipes now.

</p>
<p>
    I used to bookmark my recipes. Recently, I am trying so many new recipes from online and didn't like the way I am
    organizing my bookmarks. Then I found nextcloud cookbook. To add a recipe to
    the collection, all you have to do is paste in the URL of the recipe, it parses and downloads the recipe to your
    specified nextcloud folder as JSON.
</p>
<p>
    For the cookbook to parse your recipe, it should follow a schema.org recipe format. In my experience, most of the
    recipe sites are using this schema.
</p>
<p>
    I used <a href="https://codeberg.org/codingotaku/recipe-crawler">Recipe
        Crawler</a> to parse all my current bookmarks at once and copied to my nextcloud recipe folder. Now, I can
    filter by tags, categories, they even have <a
        href="https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook/blob/master/docs/user/clients/Index.md">Mobile app</a> which made my life easier.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you, Nextcloud Cookbook!
