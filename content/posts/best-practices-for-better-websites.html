  <p>
    I found <a href="https://darekkay.com/best-practices/" target="_blank">Best Practices for Building Better Websites
      by Darek Kay</a> when going through <a href="https://codingotaku.com/blogroll" target="_blank">Coding Otaku's
      Blogroll</a>, which is very useful for someone like me who started learning website building. I started
    implementing a few things in my website after reading the blog.<a href="https://darekkay.com/" target="_blank">
      Darek</a> has many more interesting blogs on accessibility that I have yet to explore.

    Now, I am visiting some awesome websites with web rings and blogrolls that I did not see before with search engine
    results. It feels like a new world unlocked.
