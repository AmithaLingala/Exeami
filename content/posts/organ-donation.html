  <h3>Organ Donation</h3>
  <p>
    I like to believe most people are in favour of organ donation as it can <a
      href="https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/helping-you-to-decide/personal-stories/" target="_blank">save lives</a>,
    and if
    not donated, organs are
    useless. The fact is, there are always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation#Organ_shortfall"
      target="_blank">more people waiting</a> for the organs. When I think about it, maybe many support the
    idea, but because they never got to sign for it, organs are not automatically used to save or improve other lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then comes the debate whether organ donation should be opt-in or opt-out. I might say it should be opt-out, as I
    can not
    comprehend why anyone not want to donate after death, but I know there can be reasons beyond my understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, the only solution is educating and spreading awareness about organ donation and letting individuals decide what
    is wrong or right for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you support organ donation, not only signing up for it (if you are in a country where it is opt-in), but also
    talking
    about it whenever you can, might make a difference that you might not even realize. I wish the government and
    educational institutes add it to the curriculum so that people can decide early in their life, but as I can not
    control that, I will do what I can and hope you do what you can. </p>
