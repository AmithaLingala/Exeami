    I don't want to buy anything unless I feel it's absolutely needed. I believe everyone is trying to sell you
    something, and it is important to not fall in the trap and become a lifelong consumer (I know I can't avoid it most
    of the time). This post is mostly to justify myself for buying Kobo elipsa. I bought <a
        href="https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa">Kobo elipsa</a> after thinking of
    buying it for
    more than 6 months, and it is one of the very few things which did not make me hate myself for buying it.
</p>
<p>
    I like to read, but books are costly and sometimes not accessible to read, maybe due to the size of the book or
    font. I can buy an e-reader, but I feel my book reading
    is incomplete if I don't underline the lines I like.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I
    can
    download books as PDF or EPUB from <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, copy to my elipsa
    and read. Elipsa lets me make notes on my downloaded books, which is not the case for may e-readers out there, which
    is the reason I picked this.

<p>
    I have to have a notebook for each purpose, I keep buying notebooks and never feel I have enough. Now, with elipsa I
    feel so relaxed that I can have a separate notebook for each of my needs, they gave quite few backgrounds for notes
    which makes it even more helpful.
</p>
<p>I think their handwriting to text conversion is good that it was able to convert my bad writing to beautiful notes
    which is a plus, even though I really don't need this feature.</p>
<p>
    They have only Dropbox and Google Drive as cloud storage options, I couldn't configure Nextcloud as storage yet.

<p>
    I got the e-reader, stylus and cover for Â£299. There might be e-reader with the same features out there, I couldn't
    find anything cheaper than this. Unless, you have similar requirements, I won't recommend buying it.

<p>I will try to write a complete review of Kobo Elipsa after using it for little longer, as of now, I am enjoying my
    reading and writing on Elipsa.</p>
