  When I was developing this website, It was a feat to make my website have the same look and feel in mobile or small
  screen devices as it is on my desktop. I had to compromise and make a few decisions to achieve it (I hope I did).

<p>
  One day, when browsing, I stumbled upon <a href="https://eduardoboucas.com/" target="_blank">Eduardo's website.</a>
  The moment I saw this website, I fell in love with the styles
  and the colour scheme. It is so soothing, and the feel of the newspaper made me subconsciously immerse in the site.
  Then I shared it, and the person opened it on a mobile phone, and he did not understand what I was talking about.
  The
  mobile view for this site is good, and it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design"
    target="_blank">responsive design</a>, but it did not do any justice to the desktop site. I
  felt sad as many did not experience what I did and might not even know that other version exists.</p>
<p>
  That day, I realized that many of us might be missing some wonderful things on the internet when we get stuck with
  small screen devices.
