    <h2>Little about me...</h2>

  <p>
  <h3 class="title"> What do I do?</h3>
  <p>
    I work as a backend developer, and this website is my way to learn and familiarise myself with
    the front end.<br>

    Apart from coding, I like to write (still figuring out how to do it) and cook (you might find some of my recipes
    soon on this website ðŸ˜Š).

    Also, I like things organised and ends up spending a lot of time planning things.<br>

    I love to learn something new every day, and currently exploring the Indie web, finding it wonderful.<br>
  </p>
  <h3 class="title"> Where can you find me?</h3>
  <p>

    I have a very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media besides
    LinkedIn (where I have zero activity), and the best way to know me more is this website.<br>

    You can <a href="https://exeami.com/contact"> contact me</a> for any kind of feedback or, suggestions.

    <h2>About this website</h2>
  </div>
  <p>This is my personal website.</p>

  <h3 class="title"> Exeami ðŸ¤”?</h3>
  <p>
    When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
    to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
    felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment, it made a lot of sense, as I took
    Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
    executables ðŸ˜›) and Ami from Amitha.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 class="title">What's in here?</h3>
  <p>
    As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform to share my thoughts on various
    topics, I will be sharing the things I find interesting.<br>
    Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel most important to know and talk about in this
    digital world.<br>
    Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.<br>

    You can find my <a href="/blogs">blogs</a> which generally are detailed articles and <a href="/posts">posts</a>
    which are collection of some quick writings and things I find on the internet. I also have a few of my <a
      href="/projects">projects</a> here.
