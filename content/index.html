    <h2>Little about me...</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Hi üëã,
    I'm <span class="p-name">Amitha Lingala</span>, aka exeami.
    I'm a <span class="p-job-title">Software Engineer</span>, currently living in London.

    I enjoy creating stuff, be it a DIY craft that recycles things around the house or some new recipe to try, or code
    which does cool things.

    Also, I like things organized and ends up spending a lot of time planning.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media besides
    LinkedIn (where I have zero activity), and the best way to know me more is this website.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to contact me, you can email me at <a class="u-email"
      href="mailto:contact@exeami.com">contact@exeami.com</a>,
    and you can also find me on
    <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AmithaLingala">GitHub</a> and
    <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amithalingala">LinkedIn</a>!

    <h2>About this website</h2>
  </div>
  <p>This is my personal website, this site is always under development as I am learning and changing things here
    constantly.</p>

  <h3 class="title"> Exeami ü§î?</h3>
  <p>
    When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
    to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
    felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment, it made a lot of sense, as I took
    Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
    executables üòõ) and Ami from Amitha.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 class="title">What's in here?</h3>
  <p>
    As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform to share my thoughts on various
    topics, I will be sharing the things I find interesting. Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel
    most important to know and talk about in this digital world.
    Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.</p>
  <p>
    You can find my <a href="/blogs">blogs</a> which generally are detailed articles and <a href="/posts">posts</a>
    which are collection of some quick writings and things I find on the internet. I also have a few of my <a
      href="/projects">projects</a> here.
  </p>
  <p>You can subscribe to feeds for my <a href="/blogs/atom.xml">blogs</a> and <a href="/posts/atom.xml">posts</a> now.
