        Hello...<br>

        I am Amitha Lingala aka exeami, this is my personal website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle"> ExeAmi ðŸ¤”?</h3>
    <p>
        When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
        to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
        felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment it made a lot of sense as I took
        Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
        executables ðŸ˜›) and Ami from Amitha.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle"> What do I do?</h3>
    <p>
        I work as a backend developer and when I started this website it is my way to learn and familiarise myself with
        the front end.<br>

        Apart from coding, I like to write (still figuring out how to do it) and cook (you might find some of my recipes
        soon in this website ðŸ˜Š).

        I like things organised, and I spent most of the time planning things, which helps me to stay less
        anxious.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle"> Where can you find me?</h3>
    <p>

        I have very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media (other than
        LinkedIn), and best way to know me more is this website.

        As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform for me to share my thoughts on various
        topics, I plan to write blogs whenever I have time, and I would love to make it regular.<br><br>

        Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel most important to know and talk about in this
        digital world.<br>
        <!--I try simple and tasty recipes, you will be seeing them here.<br>-->

        Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.<br><br>
