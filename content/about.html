        Hello...<br>

        I am Amitha Lingala aka exeami, this is my personal website. I love to learn something new every day, exploring
        Indie web right now, finding it wonderful.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle"> Exeami ðŸ¤”?</h3>
    <p>
        When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
        to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
        felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment, it made a lot of sense, as I took
        Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
        executables ðŸ˜›) and Ami from Amitha.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle"> What do I do?</h3>
    <p>
        I work as a backend developer and this website is my way to learn and familiarise myself with
        the front end.<br>

        Apart from coding, I like to write (still figuring out how to do it) and cook (you might find some of my recipes
        soon on this website ðŸ˜Š).

        I like things organised, and I spend a lot of time planning things, which helps me to stay less
        anxious.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle"> Where can you find me?</h3>
    <p>

        I have a very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media other
        than LinkedIn (with zero activity), and the best way to know me more is this website.

        As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform for me to share my thoughts on various
        topics. I plan to write blogs whenever I have time, and I would love to make it regular.<br><br>

        Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel most important to know and talk about in this
        digital world.<br>

        Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.<br><br>
