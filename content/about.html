        Hello...<br>

        I am Amitha Lingala aka exeami, this is my personal website.</p>

    <h3 class="title"> Exeami ðŸ¤”?</h3>
    <p>
        When I decided to make my website, I couldn't figure out what
        to name it. I wanted something simple, small and with my name in it. After considering a lot of combinations, I
        felt exeami is perfect as it is unique and available. At that moment, it made a lot of sense, as I took
        Exe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">Executable</a> (I write code and create
        executables ðŸ˜›) and Ami from Amitha.
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="title"> What do I do?</h3>
    <p>
        I work as a backend developer, and this website is my way to learn and familiarise myself with
        the front end.<br>

        Apart from coding, I like to write (still figuring out how to do it) and cook (you might find some of my recipes
        soon on this website ðŸ˜Š).<br>

        Also, I like things organised and ends up spending a lot of time planning things.<br>

        I love to learn something new every day, and currently exploring the Indie web, finding it wonderful.<br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="title"> Where can you find me?</h3>
    <p>

        I have a very low online presence, you can't find me on Twitter or Instagram or any other social media besides
        LinkedIn (where I have zero activity), and the best way to know me more is this website.

        As I have my personal website now, which is a great platform to share my thoughts on various
        topics, I will be sharing the things I find interesting. I plan to write blogs whenever I have time, and I would
        love to make it regular.<br><br>

        Mostly I will be sharing about Data Privacy, which I feel most important to know and talk about in this
        digital world.<br>

        Apart from this, I will write about things that grab my attention.<br><br>

        You can <a href="https://exeami.com/contact"> contact me</a> for any kind of feedback or, suggestions.
