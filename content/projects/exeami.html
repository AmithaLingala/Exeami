<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  I wanted to write and get better at it, so, started this site. In my initial version, I used <a
    href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> framework to make
  it easier, as in this site, I plan to spend more time on writing than worrying about the layout and styles. After a
  few months, I ended up customizing most of the styles and was spending a lot of time with making the site look
  better than writing blogs. Even for a small change in the header, I had to edit multiple files.
</p>
<p>
  So, one day I decided to scrap everything and start again. My plan is to have a script which does most of the work;
  When I want to write a blog or post, I should just need to create a new file with paragraph tag and add content.
  Everything should be auto generated for me. Now, for this site, I achieved that. I have the layout, styles
  and themes, and a script which generates all the pages from templates.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>I am using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this website.</p>
<p>I am suing Handle bars for templates and python script to generate the website content.</p>
