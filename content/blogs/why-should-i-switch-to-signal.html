    <a href="https://www.signal.org/" target="_blank">Signal</a> is a messaging app by Open Whisperer Systems,
    just
    like WhatsApp or
    iMessage or Facebook Messenger, but one
    that's geared towards privacy and security. Its encrypted, simple, and free.

        <div class="tag is-info">Signal</div> Vs <div class="tag is-success">WhatsApp</div>
    </section>
    <p class="tile">They both use the same underlying encryption "the Signal Protocol" but drastically differ
        in
        terms
        of underlying philosophy.</p><br>
    <p class="tile notification">
        <i>WhatsApp can't see what's inside the messages, but they can see who is sending a message to whom and
            when
            -
            which is large risk.<br>
            And according to the WhatsApp privacy policy, <strong>the company reserves the right to record this
                information, known as message metadata</strong>, and give it to governments.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>The only data Signal retains is the phone number you register with and when you last logged
                into
                their
                server.</strong> That's it. It doesn't even record the hour, minute, or second - only the day.</i>

    <p>
        Signal is opensource and funded by donors, on the other hand WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, leaves users
        to
        being nothing more than another data collection point for Facebook for ad-targeting.<br>
        <br>
        WhatsApp was a messaging app first and added the security features later. Signal was all about security
        first.
        Because of this, WhatsApp has more now-traditional chat features. Both Signal and WhatsApp also include
        voice
        calling and video calling to round out the messaging apps.<br>

        disappearing
        messages.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Signal, the non-profit organization points out that "there are no ads, no affiliate marketers, no
        creepy
        tracking", and it's hard to ask for much more than that in terms of privacy. And It's recommended by
        Edward
        Snowden.<br>
        When you have an alternative which doesn't need you to compromise on privacy, why not to switch to
        Signal.
