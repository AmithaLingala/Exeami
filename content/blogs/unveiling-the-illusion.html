<p> I often find myself asking: Why does marriage feel like a
    gilded cage? Why do so many of us enter this system only to discover that it can carry on underlying inequalities and create an illusion of happiness? It's time to peel back some layers of tradition and expectation around marriage, revealing the often-unspoken truths that lie beneath.</p>

<h3>The Patriarchal Foundations of Marriage</h3>
<p>To understand the current landscape of marriage, I think we must first examine its historical roots. Traditionally,
    marriage has served as a mechanism for transferring property and securing alliances, with women frequently treated
    as
    commodities rather than equal partners. For instance, the practice of dowries, where families pay a price for a
    bride, and the expectation that women adopt their husband's surname are just a couple of examples of how marriage
    can reinforce patriarchal norms.</p>
<p>Consider the implications of these customs: they not only strip women of their identities but also perpetuate the
    idea that a woman's value is tied to her marital status. In many cultures, the phrase "marriageable age" implies
    that a woman's worth diminishes as she ages without a husband. Why do we still allow these traditions to dictate our
    lives, often at the expense of our autonomy?</p>

<h3>Flaws in Wedding Traditions</h3>
<p>Then there are weddings, the grand celebrations that are supposed to mark the beginning of our happily ever after.
    Yet, why do we pour so much time, energy, and money into a single day, often overlooking the deeper implications of
    the marriage itself?</p>
<p>Wedding ceremonies frequently emphasize traditional gender roles, with the bride typically taking on a submissive
    role. The symbolism of the bride being “given away” by her father to her husband underscores the notion of women as
    property. This ritual not only perpetuates outdated views of women but also sets a precedent for the power dynamics
    that will unfold in the marriage.</p>
<p>Moreover, the average cost of a wedding often leads into debt. This financial burden can create stress and
    resentment, particularly if one partner feels they have sacrificed more for the event. Many women find joy in the
    minutiae of wedding planning, choosing flowers, dresses, and venues, often overlooking the broader implications of the
    marriage contract itself. This excitement of
    the event overshadows the potential for unequal power dynamics in the marriage that follows. Why do we let the
    celebration distract us from the realities of the partnership we are entering?</p>

<h3>The Illusion of Happiness</h3>
<p>The societal pressure to create a "perfect" wedding can also lead women to prioritize the event over their own needs
    and desires. The emphasis on making the day special can result in women feeling happy about small details, such as
    the cake or the decorations, while ignoring significant issues like financial dependence, decision-making power, and
    emotional labour within the marriage.</p>
<p>I've seen people who feel trapped in their marriages, believing they must maintain a facade of happiness for the sake
    of appearances. The pressure to project an image of a perfect life can be overwhelming, leading many to suppress
    their genuine feelings.
    Why do we prioritize the illusion of a perfect life over our authentic experiences? It's as if we
    have been conditioned to believe that admitting struggles or dissatisfaction is a failure, rather than a natural
    part
    of any relationship.</p>

<h3>Cultural Expectations Around Motherhood</h3>
<p>In many societies, there is a strong expectation for women to become mothers and prioritize family over career. This
    societal pressure can lead to discrimination against women in the workplace, as employers may assume that mothers
    will be less committed to their jobs. For instance, a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24740">study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that
        mothers are often perceived as less competent and less committed than their childless counterparts, leading to fewer
        job opportunities and lower wages.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty">motherhood penalty</a> is a well-documented phenomenon, where mothers are often passed over for promotions or given
    less challenging assignments. This systemic bias not only limits women's professional growth but also reinforces the
    stereotype that women should be the primary caregivers. Why do we continue to perpetuate these harmful stereotypes
    that limit women's potential in both their personal and professional lives?</p>



<h3>The Weight of Gender Roles</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1168961388/pew-earnings-gender-wage-gap-housework-chores-child-care">Research consistently shows that even in dual-income households, women tend to take on a disproportionate share of
    household chores and childcare responsibilities.</a> This unequal
    division of labour reinforces traditional gender roles and limits women's opportunities for personal and professional
    growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the narrative surrounding weddings often romanticizes the idea of marriage, framing it as the ultimate goal
    for women. This can create a sense of fulfilment tied to the wedding day itself, rather than to the partnership
    that follows. The societal expectation that women should be the primary caregivers and home-makers can lead to
    feelings of inadequacy and frustration, especially when women are also pursuing careers. Why do we continue to
    accept these outdated roles that limit our potential and happiness?</p>


<h3>A Call to Action: Redefining Marriage</h3>
<p>As we navigate the complexities of modern relationships, it is crucial to challenge the traditional narratives
    surrounding marriage. We must question the societal norms that dictate our choices and redefine what partnership
    means.</p>
<p>This begins with open conversations about the realities of marriage, where both partners actively engage in
    discussions about roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Couples should strive for equitable divisions of labour,
    both in the home and in emotional support. It's essential to create a partnership where both individuals feel valued
    and empowered, rather than trapped in outdated roles.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Embracing Authenticity</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the journey toward a more equitable marriage requires us to embrace authenticity over illusion. It's time
    to prioritize genuine connection and mutual respect over societal expectations and superficial celebrations. By
    acknowledging the hidden inequalities within marriage and actively working to address them, we can create
    partnerships that empower both individuals to thrive.</p>
<p>As we move forward, let us challenge the status quo and redefine what it means to be married. Let's create a future
    where partnership is not confined by tradition but is instead built on equality, respect, and shared dreams.
    Only then can we truly unveil the illusion of marriage and embrace the authentic relationships we deserve.</p>
