<h3>Backgroud</h3>
<p>
  I always felt having a search in any website is useful, and I wanted to have one in mine. Even though I know how to
  exactly navigate to the content I want in my website, I sometimes feel lazy and wish I had a quick way to ask and get
  what I want.
</p>
<p>
  The reasons why I want search are maybe obvious, but for some reason I had a feeling that it will be tough to
  implement and needs a lot of work till I actually did it. I had a fully functioning search which fits my requirements
  in less than a day of effort. That is the reason I wanted to write this blog to tell how easy it can be to have your
  own search in your website.
</p>
<p>
  When I searched how to add to search to my website in a search engine, the most popular option is
  implementing search boxes from leading search engine providers. Most of the articles pointed out how to add these
  search boxes to my site. I leaned towards adding DuckDuckGo search box as I do not need to register to the service
  like google and as always I prefer DuckDuckGo. It took few minutes to add DuckDuckGo search box to my site, it works
  well, but I did not like the fact I will be redirected to DuckDuckGo. Pardon me with the metaphore, but it felt like I
  am leaving my home to search something from my home, and did it feel right. Then I realized that I need to implement
  custom search.
</p>
<p>
  Next step in my search of adding search was to go and check in <a
    href="https://indieweb.org/search#IndieWeb_Examples">IndieWeb</a> where I found that <a
    href="/User:Petermolnar.eu">Peter Molnar</a> uses <a class="external text"
    href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#fts4">SQLite3 FTS4</a> engine for full text searching his site. That felt
  like a good way for me but I did not get to see how he did it or any reference to his code. And I knew I had to do it
  my way following the documentation.
</p>

<h3>The way I did it</h3>
<p>
  On high level, my search is simple, I need a list of web pages to crawl, need to save the content of those pages in
  db, query the db and share the page link which matches my search query using FTS.
