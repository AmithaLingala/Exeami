  If you have an Instagram account for your babies or plan to have one, I want you to think twice before doing it.
  Most of us are immature and innocent and follow the trend without being fully aware that some things we share on the
  internet might be bad for us and our loved ones in many ways.
</p>
<p>
  I want to point out a few reasons why sharing too much about kids online is not a good idea.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Consent</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When sharing personal details, pictures and day-to-day activities of your kids online, you are creating
      a personally identifiable <strong>permanent digital footprint</strong> of them whether they like it or not. I
      feel that kids
      should have a right to their digital privacy, as some of these details or fame might change events in their
      lives the way they don't want them to be, and they might not even be able to change it.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Safety</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Everyone wants to safeguard and protect their kids as they love them, and it's their duty, and they are
      responsible for the kid's safety. Predators, stalkers, and paedophiles are all over the internet. It's an easy
      way to get
      the information, so please don't be the one who provides it. I heard some parents sharing full names, locations,
      school names, bus timings, activities, and everything on social media that can become a huge safety concern. If
      not, the photo you thought was cute might expose your kids to bullies.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Misuse</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The photos you share can be misappropriated and reused, or others use them for commercial purposes without your
      knowledge. <a href="https://firewalltimes.com/instagram-data-breach-timeline/">Do not think that just because
        you have a private account, you can control who gets access to the photos.</a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Comparison</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Based on the <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-023-00013-0">DIPF | Leibniz Institute for Research and
        Information in Education, and Center for Research on Individual Development and Adaptive Education of Children
        at Risk (IDeA)</a> paper demonstrating that upward social
      comparison, comparing with people
      we consider to be socially better off is associated with reduced
      well-being such as lower life satisfaction or more depressive symptoms. The better the lives of others on social
      media, the worse we feel. Many parents compare parenting standards and doubt themselves. Many feel depressed
      when
      they get fewer likes on their baby's pictures. This is not only bad for your mental health but also affects the
      <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2156869320912520">child's well-being in the long
        term.</a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Discomfort</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>How much time do you spend getting the right picture with perfect lighting? How many photos are you taking? And
      how much time are you editing and trying to make it the best? And are you doing this for fun or for
      likes and comments? Taking a few pictures on occasion is good, but when we fall into the trap of
      being emotionally attached to the engagement of our posts, we might end up causing discomfort to our loved ones
      by unconsciously forcing them to do things that they don't want to do.

<p>
  Some parents might be doing this for commercial reasons, I don't have a say in it. But if you are doing it as
  everyone
  else doing it or for making a digital album and sharing it with close friends and family. I recommend sharing on an
  end-to-end encrypted channel like <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The above applies if you only post photos of your children to your personal account, and you shouldn't feel a
  false sense of protection. I focused on sperate account, as this means you plan to share a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Always ask yourself if it is needed or worth the attention and virtual fame before posting anything about your
  babies online. Stay safe.
