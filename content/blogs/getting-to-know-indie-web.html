    Once I was reading about how Amazon gave a platform for many small businesses to sell products online and how it
    helped them. You might even have heard that, but think about it, whenever we buy something from a small business on
    Amazon, we often relate it as we bought it from Amazon and never really remember the seller or the creator. This
    might seem trivial, but imagine if you were a seller of handmade crafts on Amazon and you had a loyal customer base
    and a good reputation. What if
    <a href="https://the-digital-reader.com/amazon-is-still-banning-authors-for-no-reason/">Amazon suddenly banned you
      from selling on their platform</a>,
    and you lost your source
    of income and your hard work? Or what if you had to <a
      href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/amazon-sellers-say-the-tech-giant-is-crushing-them-with">lower
      your prices to compete with other sellers?</a> Or <a
      href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/amazon-imposes-new-fee-on-sellers-shipping-their-own-products/articleshow/102833427.cms">pay
      a fee to
      Amazon and limit your profit margin?</a>
    Or what if you couldn't sell your products anywhere else for <a
      href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-keeps-prices-artificially-high-210059691.html">a lower price than on
      Amazon</a>
    , and you were stuck with their rules? Or
    <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-sellers-fear-bankruptcy-after-rule-change-12936803">they suddenly change
      terms and don't pay you?</a>
    Amazon is one of many examples to show the control of big corporations have on us.

      "Writing on your own website associates your thoughts and ideas with you as a person. Having a distinct website
      design helps strengthen that association. Writing for another publication, you get a little circular avatar at the
      beginning of the post and a brief bio at the end of the post, and that's about it. People will remember the
      publication, but probably not your name."

    When you know this, you want to change it and do something to change it. You also want your loved ones to be aware
    of it and own their data. The good news is, you are not alone. It's wonderful to connect with people who share your
    vision and work together for a better future. When I first got to know about IndieWeb It felt like a hope.

  <h3>What is IndieWeb?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>As Indie web is about ownership, Your content is yours, and You are in control.</strong>
  </p>

  <blockquote cite="https://indieweb.org/" class="quote">
    <p>
      "The IndieWeb is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple
      standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your
      ownsite (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data."

  <h3>Why do we need IndieWeb?</h3>
  There are many reasons why It is good to have your space on the web where you own what is yours. I am just listing
  down a few.
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you do not want to part of social media where the more you spend time and contribute, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising">the more they learn about you
        and sell you</a> (sell your browsing habits to advertisers).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't want Silos, control your experience of the web and decide <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">what you see</a> and <a
        href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/12/how-seo-is-gentrifying-the-internet">where your content goes.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't want to be part of evil where once you create a community, they keep it under paywall or
      <a href="https://indieweb.org/login_wall">authwall</a> and
      leave you
      choose to <a
        href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw">obey
        their rules or lose the community.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/tech/11271562/instagram-users-lose-accounts-taylor-swift/">don't want to
        need permission</a> to communicate, create and innovate with people around the globe with the
      internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't want to <a
        href="https://www.howtogeek.com/403769/what-happens-to-your-digital-property-when-a-company-goes-out-of-business/">
        lose all your data because the company gone out of business</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you want to show that you are not consumed by the Silos.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you want different monetization for your content in your way.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>It's not just ownership</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/personal-domain">Identity</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>Having a personal domain, which is the initial step of Indie web. It helps you to have more credibility,
      improves personal branding and makes it easy to find you.</dd>

    <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">Syndication</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>If you want to let your friends read your posts, their way using social media like Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter

      Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) And can back feed the post activity back to your website. Now we can have all in one
      place, IndieWeb comments, and comments on your POSSE copies.</dd>

    <dt><strong><a href="https://indieweb.org/microformats">MicroFormats</a></strong></dt>
    <dd> Add Microformats to your existing HTML to use structured data from your site to allow tools like feed readers.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Finally, It can be easy too…</h3>
  <p>
    I know many might think,
  <ul>
    <li>It is easy to create a silo account and post what they want with few steps.</li>
    <li>I am not a celebrity or a company to own a domain.</li>
    <li>I am not a web developer and I don't know how to do it.</li>
  </ul>

  There can many reasons and excuses we give ourselves to start. Even I am new to this, yet to understand a lot. Having
  a sense of ownership gives pleasure and made me take my first step, you can find yours.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many tools, step-by-step guides and help available in the community to make it easy. Many smart people are
    contributing to make it easier so that we can own what is ours.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do it for yourself, have fun and pride creating something that is yours, and It will get easy.
